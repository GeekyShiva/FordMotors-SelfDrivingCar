## Project Title: __Volante__ - An intelligent automobile

## Group Member Names
* Dhruv Parashar
* Shivang Shekhar
* Sudhanshu Gupta
* Tanmay Ekanath Patil
* Yash Deepak Vaidya

## Description
Volante is an intelligent self-driving car, capable of autonomously running all the driving and maneuvering components. It uses computer science principles like Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Neural Networks to develop and execute self learning models, hyperparameter tuning and repetitive evaluative measures to perfect the self-driving technology.

## Tools to be used
* TensorFlow
* Google Cloud Platform / Amazon Web Services
* Python IDLE (CPython)
* PyCharm (Python IDE)
* avr-gcc (C compiler for AVR microcontrollers)
* Arduino IDE
* Visual Studio Code (Code editor)

## Timeline

### For embedded system:
* Control RC car using Arduino (which, in turn, will be controlled by Raspberry Pi)
* Speed regulation using Arduino
* Calibrate PyCamera, ultrasound sensor, and communication between Arduino and Raspberry Pi
* Communication link between Raspberry Pi and GCP / AWS

### For machine learning:
* Data gathering and filtering
* Choosing a model
* Training the model
* Evaluating the model
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Prediction
