# Cyclomatic Complexity

## Legend

| CC score | Rank | Risk |
|----------|------|------|
| 1 - 5 | A | Low - Simple Block |
| 6 - 10 | B | Low - well structured and stable block |
| 11 - 20 |	C | Moderate - slightly complex block |
| 21 - 30 |	D |	More than moderate - more complex block |
| 31 - 40 |	E |	High - complex block, alarming |
| 41+ |	F |	Very high - error-prone, unstable block |

# Raw Metrics

| Metric | value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| LOC | 118 | The total number of lines of code. It does not necessarily correspond to the number of lines in the file. |
| LLOC | 48 | The number of logical lines of code. Every logical line of code contains exactly one statement. |
| SLOC | 47 | The number of source lines of code - not necessarily corresponding to the LLOC. |
| Comments | 18 | The number of comment lines. |
| Single comments | 13 | Single line comments |
| Multi | 33 | The number of lines which represent multi-line strings. |
| Blank | 25 | The number of blank lines (or whitespace-only ones). |
| C % L | 15% | The ratio between number of comment lines and LOC, expressed as a percentage. |
| C % S | 38% | The ratio between number of comment lines and SLOC, expressed as a percentage. |
|C + M % L | 43% | The ratio between number of comment and multiline strings lines and LOC, expressed as a percentage. |
