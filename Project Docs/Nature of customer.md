# Nature of Customer

The driverless car are coming, but significant questions remain. Will consumers actually want to cede control of their vehicles? Can autonomous cars be truly safe in a world of variable driving conditions and human error? And what could it all mean for the future of the auto sector? Here we discuss about how car manufacturers are responding and whether the art of driving will disappear.

Now we share how self-driving cars will positively impact the industry by creating a better customer experience.

- **Route Optimization** – The integration of route optimization ensures drivers take the fastest and safest route to their jobs by analyzing real-time travel conditions and avoiding traffic. And in this scenario, the driver is actually the driverless car that takes the technician, who is now a passenger, to his or her destination. A better route reduces time and fuel costs and increases productivity and profit.

- **GPS Tracking** – Real-time GPS tracking helps eliminate or mitigate customer inconvenience. Autonomous vehicles can be tracked by the customer so they know when the technician will arrive. By looking at a virtual map on a computer screen or smartphone, the customer can see where the technician is. ClickSoftware’s recent global customer experience survey found that 60 percent of all consumers say waiting a long time for a field service rep equated to a bad customer experience.

- **Virtual Assistant Support** – Rather than have customers track a vehicle, virtual assistant support will send automatic notifications with updates about when the technician will arrive, if he or she is stuck in traffic, etc. Just as you are updated about a package that is being shipped to you via FedEx or UPS, you will receive updates about when the technician will arrive. Keeping the customer informed is a big part of customer service in this industry (and any industry).

- **Autonomous Delivery** – If the repair is an easy fix that customers can do themselves, a driverless vehicle can deliver the part without a technician needing to be present, once again boosting productivity and profit.

Technology is bringing us tools and solutions that will help make businesses more productive, save them money, make them money, and, perhaps most importantly, positively impact the customer experience. And, this is just the beginning. What used to be something we would only see in the movies is becoming our reality. We are living in the future. 

Ford revealed in August 2017 its intention to launch a fully autonomous car in 2021. Speaking at Ford’s research lab in Palo Alto, California, CEO Mark Fields said the company plans to launch a “level four vehicle, which means it won’t have a steering wheel, gas or brake pedal.”
We are working towards Ford Motors goal for 2021 to make autonomous self driving cars as listed [here](https://readwrite.com/2017/08/23/ford-self-driving-cars-future-tl1/)
